# PINGG 


Simple chat room web-app made using react js ⚛️ and firebase 🔥!

## Features
* No authentication required!
* You can chat with anyone just by entering server code!
* Create a server with unique server code of your choice and join it using the same code!
* Get joke on clicking the Get a Joke button!

## Things I learnt
* This is my first react js project🤩! **(Still Learning It)**
* Used firebase firestore to store all the messages! **(It was easy!)**
* Used tailwind css for first time. **(Easy but time consuming. ~~Should have followed docs rather than trial-error method~~ 😆)**
* Used [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) api to generate random jokes. **(Easy! Used fetch for request. Couldn't deal with CORS😤)**
* Used netlify for first time! It was easy to deploy the site and see realtime changes! **(Easy!)**

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

#### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
